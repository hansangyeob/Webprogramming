          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>
            I have done some work involving Github to make create a web- site to introduce myself. At that time, I have used HTML5 to decorate my web-site so I have not really touched other code except contents.
          </div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>
            Personally, I consider myself as a programmer. However, programs should be designed for the users which involves user central design. Therefore, to be a decent programmer, I should be a good designer.

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>
            HTML is quite old computer language which used to create web – site from 1980s. in order to understand CSS or Java which is quite trend computer language in thesedays, I thought that basic knowledge about html would give me a boost. Later in this course, we learn about CSS and Java. However, previously, I should get use to HTML in order to learn others more effectively. Furthermore, designing website is quite close to getting know about trend and users so I thought that I would be a better designer as well as gaining knowledge about computer language.
          </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>
            I hope to learn about PHP which is most – used language to build web – site up to now.

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>
            Since this course has been changed to 100% online, I assume that it is not effective for me to perform all the assignments in a form of group. Personally, I prefer group work but face to face meeting is not recommended thesedays which makes it hard to communicate with m partner. For my own strength, I would say “consistency”. Because I’m in my second semester, I cannot expect great knowledge about building web - site or coding skills. However, I usually put my best effort to my works.

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>
            I have to say that I use Google and Canvas most.

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>
            I love to work out in the gym and jogging around D2 or D7.
